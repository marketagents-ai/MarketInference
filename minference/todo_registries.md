Here are detailed notes about implementing entity locking in the registry system:

# Entity Registry Locking System Notes

## Core Concepts

### Read/Write Lock Mechanism
- Use `asyncio.Lock` for write operations
- Track read count with separate lock
- Allow multiple concurrent readers
- Give writers exclusive access
- Store locks in `_locks: Dict[UUID, EntityLock]`

### Lock Types
```python
class EntityLock:
    write_lock: asyncio.Lock       # Exclusive write access
    read_count: int               # Number of active readers
    read_count_lock: asyncio.Lock  # Protect read count updates
    writing_entity: Optional[UUID] # Currently writing entity
    reading_entities: Set[UUID]    # Currently reading entities
```

## Implementation Details

### Access Patterns
1. Read Access
   - Increment read counter
   - First reader acquires write lock
   - Multiple readers can proceed
   - Last reader releases write lock
   - Use context manager pattern

2. Write Access
   - Acquire exclusive write lock
   - Block until all readers complete
   - Record writing entity ID
   - Release automatically via context manager

### Deadlock Prevention
1. Lock Ordering
   ```python
   # Add to EntityRegistry
   _lock_order: Dict[UUID, int] = {}  # Track lock hierarchy
   _lock_counter: int = 0             # Monotonic counter for ordering
   
   async def _check_lock_order(self, entity_id: UUID, dependent_ids: Set[UUID]):
       current_order = self._lock_order.get(entity_id, float('inf'))
       for dep_id in dependent_ids:
           dep_order = self._lock_order.get(dep_id, float('inf'))
           if dep_order <= current_order:
               raise PotentialDeadlockError(
                   f"Lock ordering violation: {entity_id} -> {dep_id}"
               )
   ```

2. Timeout Mechanism
   ```python
   # Configuration
   DEFAULT_LOCK_TIMEOUT = 30.0  # seconds
   
   # Modified context manager
   @asynccontextmanager
   async def get_for_write(cls, entity_id: UUID, timeout: float = DEFAULT_LOCK_TIMEOUT):
       try:
           async with asyncio.timeout(timeout):
               # ... existing lock code ...
       except asyncio.TimeoutError:
           raise LockAcquisitionTimeout(f"Timeout acquiring write lock for {entity_id}")
   ```

### Dependency Management
1. Track Entity Dependencies
   ```python
   # Example structure
   class EntityDependencies:
       direct_deps: Set[UUID]    # Immediate dependencies
       indirect_deps: Set[UUID]  # Transitive closure
       reverse_deps: Set[UUID]   # Entities depending on this one
   ```

2. Validation Before Operations
   ```python
   async def validate_operation(entity_id: UUID):
       # Check direct dependencies
       deps = get_entity_dependencies(entity_id)
       
       # Verify no write locks on dependencies
       for dep_id in deps.direct_deps:
           if is_being_written(dep_id):
               raise ResourceBusyError
               
       # Verify no dependency cycles
       if has_cycle(deps):
           raise CyclicDependencyError
   ```

## Error Handling

### Lock-Related Exceptions
```python
class LockError(Exception): pass
class LockAcquisitionTimeout(LockError): pass
class PotentialDeadlockError(LockError): pass
class ResourceBusyError(LockError): pass
class CyclicDependencyError(LockError): pass
```

### Recovery Strategies
1. Timeout Recovery
   - Release all locks held by timed-out operation
   - Log timeout event for monitoring
   - Allow configurable retry policy

2. Deadlock Recovery
   - Detect potential deadlocks before they occur
   - Enforce strict lock ordering
   - Provide mechanism to force-release locks in emergencies

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Metrics to Track
- Lock acquisition times
- Lock hold durations
- Timeout frequencies
- Deadlock near-misses
- Resource contention patterns

### Debug Information
```python
class LockDebugInfo:
    entity_id: UUID
    lock_type: Literal["read", "write"]
    acquisition_time: datetime
    waiting_threads: int
    stack_trace: str
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
async with EntityRegistry.get_for_write(entity_id) as entity:
    # Modify entity
    pass

async with EntityRegistry.get_for_read(entity_id) as entity:
    # Read entity
    pass
```

### Complex Operations
```python
async def complex_update(main_id: UUID, related_ids: Set[UUID]):
    # Validate operation
    await validate_operation(main_id)
    
    # Acquire locks in order
    ordered_ids = sort_by_lock_hierarchy([main_id, *related_ids])
    
    async with nested_locks(ordered_ids) as entities:
        # Perform updates
        pass
```

## Future Enhancements to Consider

1. Lock Prioritization
   - Add priority levels for different operation types
   - Allow high-priority operations to preempt lower-priority ones
   - Implement fair queuing for lock requests

2. Distributed Locking
   - Extend to support distributed systems using Redis or ZooKeeper
   - Handle network partitions and split-brain scenarios
   - Implement lease-based locks with automatic expiration

3. Performance Optimizations
   - Add lock striping for high-contention scenarios
   - Implement reader-writer lock optimizations
   - Add lock-free fast paths for common operations

4. Monitoring Enhancements
   - Implement lock health checks
   - Add detailed lock tracing for debugging
